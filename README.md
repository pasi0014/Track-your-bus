# React Bus Tracking Web App

## Disclaimer

Even though, there are already plenty of bus trackers out there,
the goal of this proejct is to understand how React works with TypeScript.
The purpose of this Web App is to track busses in Ottawa Area, check the schedule for stops and live track next bus arrivals.
For this Web App I'm using [OC Transpo's API](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/travel-tools/developers/dev-doc) to track busses and its schedules.

## What has been done so far?

- [x] Created Navbar and Footer components (even though it requires some improvment)
- [x] Created required intefaces.
- [x] User is able to search the bus stop by its 4 digit number (i.e 5291, 3200, etc.)

## TODO
 - [x] Finish next arrival live tracking feature (allows user to see next arrival of a bus for a selected stop)
 - [x] Refactor code and separate logic from front-end, create extra components if required 
 - [ ] Improve layout of navbar and footer components
